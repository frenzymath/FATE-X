A Galois extension such that the degree of the extension is a power of a prime \( p \) is
called a p-extension.

Let $p$ be a prime and let $F$ be a field.
Let $K$ be a finite Galois extension of $F$ whose Galois group is a $p$-group (i.e., the degree
$[K : F]$ is a power of $p$). Such an extension is called a \emph{$p$-extension} (note that
$p$-extensions are Galois by definition). Let $L$ be a $p$-extension of $K$. Prove that the
Galois closure of $L$ over $F$ is a $p$-extension of $F$.
